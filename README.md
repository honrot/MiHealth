# MiHealth

I tried to push it! 
honey@Ammons-Laptop MiHealth % git push
Username for 'https://github.com': honrot
Password for 'https://honrot@github.com': 
remote: {"auth_status":"auth_error","body":"Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations."}
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/honrot/MiHealth.git/'

Sorry, but I went with Plan B
